Identity PSK ("IPSK") Manager for Cisco ISE provides an example of how to manage the full Life Cycle of Pre Shared Keys for supported Hardware/Software through Cisco ISE.  

The sample code provided is designed to integrate with Cisco ISE via ODBC, External RESTful Services (ERS) API, and Monitoring API.  The 'Sponsor' & 'Captive' Portals can be customized.

The ODBC Connection provides the core functionality between IPSK Manager and Cisco ISE, while the API's are for other minor functionality such as performing Change of Authorizations ("CoA") and creation of Authoization Profiles for IPSK Captive Portals.
